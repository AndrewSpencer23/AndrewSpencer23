ðŸ’» Experience & Projects

Hands-on experience in FPGA design, inline assembly, microcontrollers, and C++ software. Projects span hardware-level design to higher-level programming, with a solid foundation in digital logic, embedded systems, and software engineering.

ðŸ”¹ FPGA Development (Verilog â€“ DE10 Board)

  Designed logic systems: reaction timers, RNGs, LED scrollers, display drivers.

  Built modular components: debouncers, clock dividers, 7-segment decoders.

  Programmed/tested designs in Quartus Prime (.sof bitstreams).

ðŸ”¹ Arduino Inline Assembly (ATmega328p)

  Programmed at register level with AVR inline assembly.

  Implemented shifts, rotates, and flag manipulation.

  Mixed C++ with assembly for direct hardware control.

ðŸ”¹ RP2040 Embedded C (Raspberry Pi Pico)

  Wrote embedded C for GPIO, timing, and peripherals.

  Focused on efficient, low-level microcontroller coding.

ðŸ”¹ C++ Coursework & Projects

  Completed CS1/CS2 at CMU (data structures, algorithms, OOP).

  Projects included recursion, memory management, file I/O.

  Emphasis on modularity, testing, and documentation.
