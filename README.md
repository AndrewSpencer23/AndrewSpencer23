ðŸ’» Experience & Projects

I have hands-on experience across multiple layers of embedded systems and digital design, including FPGA development, inline assembly, microcontrollers, and C++ software projects. My work spans both hardware-level design and higher-level programming, giving me a strong foundation in digital logic, embedded programming, and system integration.

ðŸ”¹ FPGA Development (Verilog â€“ DE10 Board)

Designed and implemented digital logic systems using Verilog HDL on the Intel DE10 FPGA.

Built projects such as reaction timers, random number generators, LED scrollers, and display drivers.

Created modular components like debouncers, clock dividers, and 7-segment decoders.

Programmed and tested FPGA designs using Quartus Prime with .sof bitstreams.

ðŸ”¹ Arduino Inline Assembly (ATmega328p)

Programmed the Arduino Uno at the register and assembly level.

Implemented low-level instructions for shifts, rotates, and flag manipulation.

Integrated inline assembly with C++ to directly control hardware behavior.

Gained experience with the AVR instruction set and the status register (SREG).

ðŸ”¹ RP2040 Embedded C (Raspberry Pi Pico)

Developed embedded programs in C for the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040).

Worked with GPIO, timing, and peripheral control at the hardware level.

Applied embedded C coding practices for efficiency and hardware interaction.

ðŸ”¹ C++ Coursework & Projects

Completed CS1 and CS2 coursework in C++ at CU Boulder.

Implemented data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented designs.

Built projects covering recursion, dynamic memory management, file I/O, and more.

Strengthened software engineering practices including modularity, testing, and documentation.
